Hello, I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Yau Mathematical Sciences Center](http://ymsc.tsinghua.ofapp.net/en), Tsinghua University in Beijing, China.
My research interest lies in Riemannian Geometry, Optimal Transport Thoery, and Graph Theory. In particular, I study Ricci curvature notions in discrete spaces.

Here are some GIFs of [_transport geodesics_].
